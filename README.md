## Intro

In this project, our goal is to delve into the heart of this rich and expansive narrative using the power of graph databases. We aim to create a dynamic and interconnected representation of the Star Wars universe, where characters, planets, starships, and vehicles are nodes, and their relationships form the edges of a comprehensive graph.

## Dataset

For this project, we have utilized a comprehensive Star Wars dataset sourced from reputable platforms such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/star-wars) and [GitHub](https://github.com/fgeorges/star-wars-dataset). The primary dataset, available at Kaggle, offers a diverse collection of information, including details about characters, starships, planets, and more, providing a solid foundation for our graph database exploration.

Additionally, we have incorporated data from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fgeorges/star-wars-dataset) maintained by contributors passionate about the Star Wars universe. This repository enhances the dataset's richness by including additional attributes, relationships, and potentially unique insights.

By merging these datasets, our aim is to create a robust and interconnected graph representation of the Star Wars universe. This combined dataset forms the backbone of our project, allowing us to navigate the galaxy's intricacies and explore the relationships that define the epic narrative of Star Wars.

## TODO (for future)
 - add films csv and generate ttl file and link with other ttls
